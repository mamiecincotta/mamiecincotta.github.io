### Analysis:

a\. The survey is structured with an introduction first,

b\. The questionnaire is composed of questions about levels of agreement/disagreemnet with given statements, purchasing habits, willingness to buy certain theoretical products and what the pricing should be, and demographic information.

c\. The questions are ordered with the agreement/disagreement assessments being placed first, questions about purchasing habits coming after, and demographic information being placed last.

### Improvements:

I think the page breaks could be placed in a way to keep related questions grouped together on the same page. This would improve user experience by allowing the respondent to view their responses to related questions.
